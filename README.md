![Personal Projects GitHub Carlos Pascual](https://github.com/cdeveloping/personal-projects/assets/134525703/6e900d53-8578-4279-aec3-92be7b66047e)

<p>In this repository you will find some personal projects that I am creating, some are simple examples and others will be more complex applications.</p>
<p>I will organize the different projects by language in separate folders, this way it will be easier to locate the type of project or language you want to see.</p>
<p>In this Readme file, which I will give a more elaborate format, I will put links to the projects, also dividing them by language.</p>

# Language

<li>Phyton</li>
<li>HTML</li>
